In this notebook, I have tried 2 models. First Model is skip connection neural network using Functional API and then Second Model is a CNN Model. Both of the model achienved approximately same result which is discernible in confusion matrix below after every model. I have used ImageDataGenerator function for Image Augmentation. Scale, Zoom, rotation,shift are some properties that has been changes for image augmentation. Both model performance is also compared at the end of notebook.

Model 1 : Functional Model with Skip Connection <br/>
Model 2 : Sequential CNN Model<br/>
